This place is swarming of terrible creatures dominating this Godforsaken lands. 
These creatures, made from the slime and rotten flesh of their victims, exude an animalistic hatred of all living things. 
And in the center of this place - the lord of these creatures and the scariest one. 
It is... a travesty - a blundering mountain of hatred... and rage. Beacons in the darkness, stars in the emptiness of the void. 
A sickened, sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands, and whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation, corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities, charnel winds that brush the pallid stars and make them flicker low. 
Beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things; half-seen columns of unsanctified temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness. 
And through this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled, maddening beating of drums, and thin, monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond Time; 
the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic, tenebrous ultimate godsâ€”the blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul is Nyarlathotep. 
Malkavian creature of tremendous size radiates antediluvian horror. Your companions felt uneasy even thinking about a contact to this creature. 
During the suicidal attempt to achieve and slay this horrible creature you can either Defect (D) or Cooperate (C) with your companions. 
If both of you Cooperate (C) you maximize your chances to survival lowering the risk being ambushed or being hit from the back. 
If any one of you is Defecting (D), the other will likely be perished in the abyss, the survivor likely gets away with all the reward... if there's any.
In condition where both decided to Defect (D) and betray the companion, the Malkavian creatures will overcome your combat skills. 
Will you manage to survive at this great peril?"""
